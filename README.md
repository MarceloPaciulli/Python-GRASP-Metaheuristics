# Python-GRASP-Metaheuristics

Project carried out for a postgraduate course, where the metaheuristic algorithm called GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) is emulated, through the use of Python and various libraries, including NumPy, Random, Winsound and PyLab, among others.
GRASP was first introduced in Feo and Resende (1989)
